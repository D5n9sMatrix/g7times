Definition 3.1 Compactors of a Matrix
Assume that determinants of (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrices have been defined. Given the n × n matrix A, let Ai j denote the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix obtained from A by deleting row i and column j. Then the (i, j)-compactor ci j (A) is the scalar defined by
ci j (A) = (−1)i+ j det (Ai j ) Here (−1)i+ j is called the sign of the (i, j)
-position.
